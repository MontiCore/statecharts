 * Step02ChangeInternTrans.sctrans
 *
 * First step of optimization step 2.
 * - Removes a intern transition
 * - Adds a final initial substate with parent-name + "_intern".
 * - Creates a self-loop-transition on the newly created substate with origin transition body.
 * Note that using this transition multiple times can create multiple intern substates, if the
 * original state has more than one intern transition. In this case use Step02RemoveDuplicatedSubstates.sctrans
 * to remove duplicate intern substates.
