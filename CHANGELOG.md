# 7.1.0-SNAPSHOT
to be released  
based on MontiCore 7.1.0-SNAPSHOT
* added the functionality to generate CDs using state patterns using the `gen` option
* added `ct` and `fp` options to influence the generation with a config template and a template path respectively
* added `hcp` option to specify a hand-written path (for the TOP mechanism of the generation)

# 6.8.0-SNAPSHOT
to be released  
based on MontiCore 6.8.0-SNAPSHOT

# 6.7.0
released: 05.02.2021

* the `s` parameter now expects the file name and not the folder anymore
* added new lines to reports
* extended documentation


# 6.6.0
released: 15.12.2020  
based on MontiCore 6.6.0

* new `path` option to add paths to the model path
* symbol table creation via genitors
* renamed parameter `st` to `s`
* migrated all visitors to use new traverser structure
* `UMLStatecharts` now extends `MCReturnStatements` such that transitions can have returns

# 6.5.0
released: 12.11.2020  
based on MontiCore 6.5.0

* StateInvariants no longer extends StateHierarchy to ensure invariants can be used without hierarchical states
    * SCInvState replaced SCStateInvariant
    * changed the concrete syntax from `state Foo { [a>b] };` to `state Foo [a>b] { };`  
* introduced grammar `SCEvents` for events definitions
  * example: `event String foo(int a)`
  * `UMLStatecharts` now supports events definitions by integrating this grammar
* Transitions now directly point to states via `Name@SCState`
* `Statechart` nonterminal divided into `NamedStatechart` and `UnnamedStatechart`, which both implement the newly created interface nonterminal `Statechart`


# 6.4.0
released: 27.10.2020   
based on MontiCore 6.4.0

* fixed handling of optional statechart name in symbol table creation
* improved documentation

# 6.2.0
released: 07.10.2020  
based on MontiCore 6.2.0

* added option to store symbols
* added reports about branching degree, state names and reachable states
* New CLI tool to process UMLStatecharts 
* Pretty printers for new grammar structure
* New grammar structure composed of the following grammars:
  * `SCActions`, `SCBasis`, `SCCompleteness`, `SCDoActions`, `SCStateHierarchy`, `SCStateInvariants`, `SCTransitions4Code`, `SCTransitions4Modelling`, `TriggeredStatecharts`, `UMLStatecharts`
