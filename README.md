# Statechart Language in MontiCore



Statecharts are a comfortable language to describe behavior based on
the internal state of a component. Statecharts have originally been
invented and described in [Harel'87] and were given a sound semantical
basis. They extend automata theory in various forms, including
hierarchy, actions, etc. Statecharts are the foundational behavior
description during which for modeling standards, such as UML and
SysML.

Dependent on the application domain, several forms of Statecharts are
needed for example to accommodate stimuli in form of method calls,
incoming values (signals) or only preconditions that trigger certain
forms of actions.

## Project Structure
* [**doc**](doc) contains images used for the documentation of the language
* [**src/test/resources/examples**](src/test/resources/examples) contains exemplary
  Statecharts models
* [**src/main/grammars**](src/main/grammars) contains language components provided
  for statecharts
* detailed [**language description**](src/main/grammars/de/monticore/Statecharts.md)
  for language developers

## Textual Syntax 

Here is a small teaser for the UML Statechart language, which allows a
method call as stimulus, Java expressions as constraints and Java
blocks/statements as actions:

```
statechart Door {
  state Opened [9 < now < 18];  // state with invariant
  initial state Closed;
  state Locked;
                                // transitions 
  Opened -> Closed  close() ;
  Closed -> Opened  open()    / { count++; ringTheDoorBell(); };
  Closed -> Locked  timeOut() / lockDoor(); ;
  Locked -> Closed  [isAuthorized() && keyFits()] unlock() ;
}
```

This example models the three states of a door: `Opened`, `Closed`, and `Locked`
and four transitions (each terminated by `;`).
- States may be marked with `initial` and `final`.
- A *transition* is defined by `source -> target` states,
  a *stimulus*, such as a method call `close()`,
  a *trigger condition* `[...]`, and an action `/ ...`.
- *Expressions* can be used for *conditions*, and *statements*
  respectively blocks `{...}`
  for the *actions*.

Further language concepts of the UML Statechart are shown in the following
example, where state
`EngineRunning` has two substates as well as *entry*, *exit* *actions*
and an *invariant*:

<a name="example2"></a>
``` 
statechart Car {
  initial state EngineOff;
  state EngineRunning [!fuelIsEmpty] {  // state with substates and state invariant (Boolean expression)
    entry / {lightsOn(); }              // entry / exit action
    exit  / {lightsOff();}
    initial state Parking;              // substates
    state Driving;
  };
}
```

Expressions and statements are taken from MontiCores basic grammar library
and can be extended by any own interesting language constructs
(such as sending or receiving messages `!m` or `?m`)

Further example models such as [`Door.sc`](src/test/resources/examples/uml/Door.sc) or [`Car.sc`](src/test/resources/examples/uml/Car.sc) can be found here:
[src/test/resources/examples](src/test/resources/examples).

## Tool Download
* [**Download UML Statecharts Tool**](http://www.monticore.de/download/MCStatecharts.jar)

Alternatively, the tools can be built from source code.

## Build the Tools
This section explains how to build and set up the command line interface tools
for the SC languages from the source code of the tool. Alternatively, the
tool can be [downloaded](#Tool-Download).

##### Prerequisites
To build the project, it is required to install a Java 8 JDK and git.

##### Step 1: Clone Project with git

    git clone <link to this Git repository>
    cd sc-language

##### Step 2: Build Project with gradle

    gradle build --refresh-dependencies

##### Step 3: Find Results

* The jars of the tools are now available in `target/libs`.
* A report of executed tests of the tool is found in `target/reports/tests/test/index.html`.
* Example generation results can be found in `target/gentest*` directories.

## Tool Parameters

The [StatechartsTool](src/main/java/de/monticore/UMLStatechartsTool.java) offers options 
for processing Statechart models.
It provides through the CLI as follows:

`java -jar MCStatecharts.jar [-h] -i <fileName> [-path <p>] [-pp [<file>]] [-s [<file>]]`

where the arguments are:

| Option                            | Explanation |
| ------                            | ------ |
| `-ct,--configTemplate <file>`     | Provides a config template (optional)|
| `-fp,--templatePath <pathlist>`   | List of directories to look for handwritten templates to integrate (optional)" |
| `-gen,--generate <dir>`           | Prints the state pattern CD-AST to stdout or the generated java classes to the specified folder (optional) |
| `-genr,--genreport <dir>`         | Specifies the directory for printing reports about the given model.  |
| `-h,--help`                       | Prints this help information   |
| `-hcp,--handcodedPath <pathlist>` |   List of directories to look for handwritten code to integrate (optional) |
| `-i,--input <file>`               | Reads the source file (mandatory) and parses the contents as a statechart |
| `-path <pathlist>`                | Sets the artifact path for imported symbols, space separated |
| `-pp,--prettyprint <file>`        | Prints the Statechart-AST to stdout or the specified file (optional) |
| `-r,--report <dir>`               | Prints reports of the statechart artifact to the specified directory. This includes e.g. reachable states and branching degrees  |
| `-s,--symboltable <file>`         | Stores the symbol table of the given Statechart |
| `-t,--trafo <groovyscript>`       | Specifies the path for a groovy script applying transformations (optional) |
| `-var,--variant <name>`           | Choose the generation variant (possible e.g.: StatePattern1 (default), StatePattern2) |

exemplary usage:

```
  java -jar MCStatecharts.jar -h
  java -jar MCStatecharts.jar -i Car.sc -pp
  java -jar MCStatecharts.jar -i DoorExample.sc -gen myDoors 
``` 

## Transformation Engine

The statechart language project also comes with a model transformations
engine based on MontiTrans. It supports defining transformations utilizing 
the concrete syntax of the language for a more intuitive mapping of model 
elements. Look [here](./doc/Transformations.md) for further information.
